My first paper[Multi-matrices entropy discriminant ensemble learning for imbalanced problem.pdf](https://github.com/tacticalmt/Multi-matrices-entropy-discriminant-ensemble-learning-for-imbalanced-problem/files/6409507/Multi-matrices.entropy.discriminant.ensemble.learning.for.imbalanced.problem.pdf)


I don't remember if the code is the final version and it maybe run on matlab either version 2010b? or 2017b. not sure
the code just was found in my computer, so I uploaded it to commemorate.
even if it is not final version, the content should be almost close to final version, perhaps.
